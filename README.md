When working with parallel programming, ensuring thread safety during updates to shared variables is crucial. We couldn't use reduction or atomic operations on the globalOss variable because these mechanisms are designed to handle numeric data types and their associated operations (e.g., addition, multiplication). Since globalOss is a non-numeric variable, such as a string or complex data structure, these operations are not applicable. Instead, we used the critical directive, which was the only solution capable of safely handling both numeric and non-numeric variables by ensuring exclusive access to the variable during updates.
